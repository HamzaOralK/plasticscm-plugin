  <p>
    <b>Minimal cleanup</b> - Do as minimal workspace changes as possible. Only changed files will be reverted. Private
    and ignored files will be preserved. This can cause unwanted side effects. It is recommended to explicitly mark
    files as ignored if those should be kept between builds.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Standard cleanup</b> - Undo changed files and remove files which are not version controlled or explicitly
    ignored. Private files will be deleted. Ignored files will be preserved. <i>Recommended.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Full cleanup</b> - Undo changed files and remove all files that are not present in the repository to have a
    pristine workspace. Private and ignored files will be deleted.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Delete workspace</b> - All workspace content will be deleted and a new repository will be created. Files will
    be redownloaded ensuring workspace is in pristine state. This operation can take very long time depending on the
    size of the repository. <i>Not recommended.</i>
