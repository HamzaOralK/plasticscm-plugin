    Use .NET invariant globalization by setting the 'DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT' environment variable to 1.

    Some Jenkins installations in Linux don't come with the ICU (International Components for Unicode) Linux package
    installed. This is required to run standalone .NET applications, such as the Plastic SCM CLI client. You can run
    into the following error:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>
      Process terminated. Couldn't find a valid ICU package installed on the system. Set the configuration flag
      System.Globalization.Invariant to true if you want to run with no globalization support.
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Enabling this flag avoids this error.
